            <h1 class="headingAbout_1">Who are we?</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">We want to make the government more accessible to 
                students and increase youth involvement in the political process. <b>Weâ€™re non-partisan, committed to the concepts of 
                good government, and wholly dedicated to the political and civic empowerment of 
                our next generation of students.</b>
            </p>
            <p>Currently, we're working to create a network of <b>Youth Policy Cabinets (YPCs)</b>
                around the country in offices at all different levels of government. In our plan, 
                YPCs will be cohorts of high school students that live or attend school in the office's
                district, and will meet on a regular schedule. During meetings, members of the cohorts
                will discuss policy issues important to their community, attend lectures with guest
                speakers and panelists and work toward developing solutions to current problems they find 
                pressing.
            </p>
            <p>Down the line, we hope to cultivate a network of YPCs that will allow for larger
                political discussions and region-wide events, as well as greater commuication and
                collaboration between students from different backgrounds and communities.
