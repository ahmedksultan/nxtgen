            <p class="text-justify">

                As three recent high school graduates, our personal experiences working alongside elected officals and with governmental organizations made us 
                realize the lack of youth voice in the political process. <b> We're a non-partisan organization that intends on make the government more accessible to 
                students, increase youth involvement in policy-making, and civically empowering the next generation of leaders. </b>
            </p>
            <p> To accomplish our mission, we plan to foster civic engagement and public service in young people through creation of Youth Policy Cabinets (YPCs)
                nationally. YPCs will exist as entities run by elected officals and their offices with our support. These cohorts of high school students living or 
                attending school in the office's district will meet regularly to discuss policy issues important to their community, attend lectures with guest
                speakers and panelists, and work toward developing solutions&#8212;ranging from bill writing to community-centered projects&#8212;to address current problems, 
                especially those that matter directly to youth, that they find pressing. We want students to have a seat at the table to ensure that YPCs are a meaningful, 
                impactful and educational experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In a little over a month, we have already started <b>four</b> YPCs in New York. Our work has just begun. We are currently in talks with several more
                offices in New York State. At the same time, we have started expanding our operation nationally through teams now in North Carolina, California, and Massachusetts. 
            </p>
            <p>
               As we grow, we hope to address the issues of polarization and division our nation struggles with. By bringing together students from different
               backgrounds, communities, and political affiliations, we remain hopeful that we will engage in critical conversations, and work to create a better tomorrow.
