            <b>Are you a government office seeking to start a YPC for youth in your community?</b>

            <br><br>
            Having worked in both local and federal level governmental offices, we understand how busy offices and staffers are. We don't want to make this
            an added burden for you, so let us help make this easier for you. Establshing a YPC will be an active collaboration between the staff
            at the office and our team at Project NextGen. We'll help facilitate the recruitment process, plan basic training and sessions, as well as 
            create materials, resources and meeting agendas. Your team would be responsible for hosting meetings and creating unique opportunities for 
            students in these YPCs. Reach out to <a href="mailto:exec@projnextgen.org">exec@projnextgen.org</a> for our one pager and our curriculum 101 outline and
            together lets create an authentic youth-adult partnership, .                        
            <br><br>
            <b>Are you a partner organization hoping to collaborate with us?</b>
            <br><br>
            We are looking to collaborate with like-minded organizations that value student voice, youth empowerment, and civic engagement. Reach out to <a href="mailto:exec@projnextgen.org">contact@projnextgen.org</a> with 
            how we can help you or how you'd like to help us.
